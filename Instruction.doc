Program to determine the zero bus quantities :


Here two input data file are there :
1.busxx.dat	- xx represents the bus numbers.


Output Files are :
1.Resultxx.out
2.Resultxx.out

zerobus.c is the main C file. // Det - To determine the unknown quantites of the user specified buses (Individual buses alone)
Overall.c is also another main C file to determine the unknown quantities of all other buses by considering (zerobus) one at a time.

In order the get the different test system output, we have to change the data in Offline.txt file

*********************************************
Where to change in Offline.txt file

busxx.dat	-- xx may be 12 or 33 or 69 bus distribution system.
1Ybus.txt
2Volt.txt	-- Starting with 1,2,3,4 .txt are intermediate file.	
3Jaco.txt 	   to check our outputs at every step.
4Inv.txt
Resultxx.out	-- xx may be 12 or 33 or 69 bus distribution system.
*********************************************

Limitations : 
  upto now this code is written by considering the system without any tie switches. 
This cannot be used if we considered tie switches in the system.
